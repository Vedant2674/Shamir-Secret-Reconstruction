# Shamir-Secret-Reconstruction
This project provides a simple implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing reconstruction algorithm using Lagrange interpolation at x = 0. It takes encoded share data from JSON files (with values in various number bases), decodes them, and computes the original secret without using external libraries.
